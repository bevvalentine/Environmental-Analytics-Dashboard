# Environmental-Analytics-Dashboard
Designed and developed a user-friendly dashboard for state officials to utilize when tracking flood concerns after storms in the area. Produced the dashboard in Excel and displayed snowstorms, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and other weather anomalies and their effects on the State of New Hampshire. Produced a data pamphlet with explanations for the public.

Excel file was not included because it was programmed with the dataset for the entire United States and GitHub would not accept such a large file, even when compressed to a .zip file. If you are interested in my work I can share privately.
